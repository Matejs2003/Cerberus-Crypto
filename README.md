# Cerberus-Crypto
The Cerberus Protocol is a community driven, fair launched DeFi Token. Three simple features are included in each transaction: LP Acquisition, Holders Rewarding and Token Burning. Some call it "the Anti-PaperHand system", we call it our path, rewarding people that stay on board.

Here, on our official Github repository you can check what's behind our contract. Our source code is public.
